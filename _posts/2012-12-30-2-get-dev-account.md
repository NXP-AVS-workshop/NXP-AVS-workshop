### Register for an Amazon Developer Account

Unless you already have one, go ahead and create a free developer account at [developer.amazon.com](https://developer.amazon.com/login.html). Click "sign in" at the upper right corner and create your account (or log in with your existing credentials).  You can review the **AVS Terms and Agreements** [here](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-voice-service/support/terms-and-agreements).

### Register Your Product and Create a Security Profile

After you've registered for an Amazon developer account, you'll need to create an Alexa device and security profile. This will enable your client to connect to the Alexa Voice Service (AVS) in the cloud.

1. Login to Amazon Developer Portal - [developer.amazon.com](https://developer.amazon.com/login.html)
2. Click on Alexa tab, and then click on Get Started button under Alexa Voice Service.

3. If this is your first time using AVS, then you will get a welcome screen. Click on the **GET STARTED** button. If you have already used AVS before, then instead click the **Create Product** button.

Now, follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/alexa/avs-device-sdk/wiki/Create-Security-Profile) to create the rest of your security profile!
